# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## API config

Store API URL (and optional keys) in a **`.env`** file at the project root (it’s gitignored). Use the **`EXPO_PUBLIC_`** prefix so Expo injects them into the bundle automatically. The app reads them in `consts/api.ts` (no app.config needed).

Create `.env` with:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

- **iOS Simulator:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Android Emulator:** `http://10.0.2.2:3000`
- **Physical device:** `http://YOUR_MACHINE_IP:3000` (e.g. `http://192.168.1.5:3000`)

Never commit real secrets. For user auth the API uses the `x-user-id` header; replace the dev placeholder in the create-recipe screen with a real token once you add login.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
